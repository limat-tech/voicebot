rasa==3.6.21

# --- FLASK ECOSYSTEM CONFLICT RESOLUTION ---
# PROBLEM: A three-way conflict between rasa, flask-sqlalchemy, and flask.
# 1. `rasa` requires `SQLAlchemy < 1.5.0`.
# 2. Latest `flask-sqlalchemy` requires `SQLAlchemy >= 2.0`.
# 3. Our compromise, `flask-sqlalchemy==2.5.1`, requires an older `flask` version (<2.3).
# SOLUTION: We pin all three packages to a "known good set" of versions that are compatible.

Flask<2.3
Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.5.1
SQLAlchemy>=1.4.0,<1.5.0

# --- Other Flask-related packages ---
# These can generally be left without pins, as pip will select versions
# compatible with the older Flask we have specified.
Flask-Migrate
Flask-JWT-Extended
python-dotenv

# --- Database Driver and Requests ---
psycopg2-binary
